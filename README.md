# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

## Neural Network :
### A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature.

### In this project e try to predict handwritten digits using neutal networks using MNIST dataset.
